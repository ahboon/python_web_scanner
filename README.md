# Python Web Scanner (PWS)

##### Version 1.0.1 

This project was inspired by a bored afternoon after getting root on a vulnhub vm. This python script was developed on Python 3. 

Usage:

Open up main.py and change the variable `base_url` to your target url. `Example: http://www.example.com , http://192.168.0.1 `

Run `main.py` normally and wait for it to end. Output will be shown in terminal.

(Manage your threading instances by changing the counter value condition from default: 15000) WARNING: MAY FAIL DUE TO MULTIPLE REQUESTS AND TARGET SERVER IS UNABLE TO REPLY IN TIME.
