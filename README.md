# Python Web Scanner (PWS)

##### Version 1.0.0

This project was inspired by a bored afternoon after getting root on a vulnhub vm. This python script was developed on Python 3. 

Usage:

Open up main.py and change the variable `base_url` to your target url. `Example: http://www.example.com , http://192.168.0.1 `

Run `main.py` normally and wait for it to end. A file called `output_file.txt` will be created.
